# bachin-writer

## Follow these instructions to run the writer locally. 

Start by cloning this repository. (in a terminal, run `git clone https://github.com/martinvaughn/bachin-writer.git`)

Once you've downloaded the files, make your way in a terminal to the newly cloned bachin-writer directory. (using cd, you should be able to ls and see bachin-writer.py in the current directory)

Make sure you have python 3 downloaded. This can be done by running `python3 --version` or `python --version` in your terminal. 
If this returns an error or anything other than Python 3._._, then you'll need to download python 3 here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once downloaded, you should be able to run `python3 --version` and have it return something like Python 3.10.0

Next run `pip3 install svg-stack` in the terminal.

Now everything is ready!

The way to run your code is to type in the terminal this command, with the sentence you want to include in quotation marks:

`python3 bachin-writer.py "your sentence goes here"`
